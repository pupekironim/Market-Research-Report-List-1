<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavelength Division Multiplexer Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CWDM</li><li>DWDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM) market comprises two primary types: Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). CWDM typically operates with wider channel spacing, allowing for fewer wavelengths over shorter distances, making it cost-effective for access networks. Conversely, DWDM utilizes closely spaced channels, supporting a higher number of wavelengths over longer distances, ideal for high-capacity backbone networks. Both technologies enhance data transmission by enabling multiple signals to coexist on a single optical fiber.</p></p>
