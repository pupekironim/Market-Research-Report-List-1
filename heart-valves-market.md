<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valves market comprises three main types: transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive devices used in procedures like TAVR, ideal for high-risk patients. Tissue heart valves, made from biological materials, offer natural function and typically require replacement after 10-20 years. Mechanical heart valves, constructed from durable materials, provide longevity but necessitate lifelong anticoagulation therapy. Each type serves specific patient needs and influences market dynamics based on efficacy and safety.</p></p>
